## Open Questions

Questions asked at the end of the session.

"The pilot product, Platform Events for Heroku, offers a point and click interface to allow Salesforce Platform Events to flow into Heroku Kafka.  Can data flow in both directions?  Meaning, does this product allow Salesforce to consume events on the Kafka bus?"

Answer, as of January 20, 2020, from the Product Team:

"It is currently one way from SF to Kafka".
